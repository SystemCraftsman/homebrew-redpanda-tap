        Redpanda - The fastest queue in the west!

        This installs RPK which, with Docker, enables the running of a local cluster 
        for testing purposes.

        You can start a 3 node cluster locally using the following command: 

            rpk container start -n 3
        
        You can then interact with the cluster using commands like the following: 

            rpk api status
        
        When done, you can stop and delete the cluster with the following command:
            
            rpk container purge

        For information on how to setup production evironments, check out our
